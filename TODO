Taylor_Expansion branch:
- (DONE) Add a MatrixMatrixFunc type of derivative for elementwise product.
- (DONE) FIXME: even though the row and colume number do not meet the 
  the requirement, e.g trace(mat(3*4)) the symbolic calculator also 
  has an output. ( -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug )
- Exception handlings.(violation of linear algebra rules. Invalid input etc).
- (DONE)Operator * for ScalarMatrixFunc class. 
  e.g. (f*g' + f'g) SalarMatrixFunc * MatrixMatrixFunc.
- Operator / for ScalarMatrixFunc class? There is no "/" between SMF and MMF. 
//  08/14/2014
- Add samples showing how to use the program. (1 Taylor, 1 Derivative, 1
  Elemental.)
- Add "int" * SMF in calculator 
- Add more details about calculator in README.md  and mention that elemental
  does not run on Windows. If you do not need to use elemental you only need to
  install boost and cmake and a git which can download the source from github.
